# Bachlor-project-py
For my bachelor's project, I worked on a project related to **Artificial Intelligence**.<br> 
This repository is solely for learning purposes and is not my actual project.<br>
The topic of my project was to
> Write Python code that could recognize faces from a camera, verify the entry face, and provide the URL of the picture and entry time. This data would then be sent to a database and a Telegram bot.
