The network leverages different CNN models, filter sizes, and pooling layers to extract features from MRI images, enabling precise classification of AD subtypes and stages. Accurate classification can aid in early detection, personalized treatment planning, disease monitoring, and prognostic assessment, showcasing the potential of this CNN architecture to assist medical professionals and researchers in making informed decisions about AD patients.\n"

Its high sensitivity allows for early disease detection. Different MRI sequences are suited for different disorders, and MRI images are frequently used for Alzheimer's disease classification. Features extracted from MRI images, **such as grey and white matter volumes, cortical thickness, and CSF levels, aid in categorizing and diagnosing mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease**. Pre-trained CNNs show promise in automatically diagnosing cognitive illnesses from brain MRI images."
