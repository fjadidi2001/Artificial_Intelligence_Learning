v1
- train = 0.8, test = 0.2
- pre-processing
- Accuracy is strong across all models, but there may be some bias.

v2
- Two-way data split
    - simple split
    - k-fold

- pre-processing
- Train the model using k-fold cross-validation to achieve high accuracy across all models.

v3
This version continues from version 2, with TabNet models training on a straightforward split.

- split dataset into train, validation, and test
- pre-process data
- Train the model and obtain results; overfitting may occur.
