In machine learning and deep learning, the most commonly used data file format is **Comma Separated Values (CSV)**.
<br>
A CSV file is just plain text with many rows of data, and each row has a fixed number of columns separated by commas.
<br>
The easiest way to create a CSV file and read a CSV file is to use the Pandas library.
