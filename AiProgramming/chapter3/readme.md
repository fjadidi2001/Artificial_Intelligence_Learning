> AI covers a broad area, and one of the most important aspects of AI is machine learning.

What is Machine Learning?
<br>

    - Machine learning (ML) is basically a set of mathematical algorithms.
    - Ml is an important subset of AI
    - it is the science that aims to teach computers, or machines, to learn from data and to analyze data automatically, without human intervention.
    - It includes a set of mathematical algorithms that can make a decision or, more accurately, predict the results for a given set of data.

Four different categories of ML:

    1. Supervised Learning
        - trained with labeled data
        - algorithms continuously adjust the parameters of models until the error calculated between the output and the desired output for a given input is minimized
        - used in classification and regression
                - classification: identify, for a given input sample, which class belongs to
                    - most popular algorithms: support vector machines, naive Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, decision trees, k-­nearest neighbor algorithm, neural networks

                - regression: the given data, fit the data with a model to get the best-­fit parameters
                    - linear regression, logistic regression, and polynomial regression.
    2. Unsupervised Learning
        - fed with unlabeled data
        - algorithms will study the data and divide it into groups according to features
        - used for clustering and association
            - clustering: dividing the data into groups
                - K-means clustering
            - association: means to discover rules that describe the majority portion of the data.
                - Apriori algorithm
    3. Semi-Supervised Learning
        - both labeled data and unlabeled data are used
        - The basic procedure is to group the data into different clusters using an unsupervised learning algorithm
        - then using the existing labeled data to label the rest of the unlabeled data.
        - most popular alghorithem: self-­training, generative methods, mixture models, and graph-­based methods.
        - can typically be used in speech analysis, internet content classification, and protein sequence classification.
    4. Reinforcement learning
        - algorithms learn to find, through trial and error, which actions can yield the maximum cumulative reward
        - used in robotics, video gaming, and navigation

### commonly terminologies
    1. Class: The categories of the data
    2. Features: The measurements
    3. Samples: The data points
    4. Parameters: The variables of the model

# SVM
    - Support vector machine (SVM) is the best-­known supervised learning algorithm.
    - can be used for both classification and regression problems
    - robust prediction methods, based on the statistical learning framework.
    

# PCA
    - Principal component analysis
    - maximizes the variance of the projected points
    - minimizing the sum-of-squares of the projection errors
