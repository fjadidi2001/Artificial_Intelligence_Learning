> AI covers a broad area, and one of the most important aspects of AI is machine learning.

What is Machine Learning?
<br>

    - Machine learning (ML) is basically a set of mathematical algorithms.
    - Ml is an important subset of AI
    - it is the science that aims to teach computers, or machines, to learn from data and to analyze data automatically, without human intervention.
    - It includes a set of mathematical algorithms that can make a decision or, more accurately, predict the results for a given set of data.

Four different categories of ML:

    1. Supervised Learning
        - trained with labeled data
        - algorithms continuously adjust the parameters of models until the error calculated between the output and the desired output for a given input is minimized
        - used in classification and regression
                - classification: identify, for a given input sample, which class belongs to
                    - most popular algorithms: support vector machines, naive Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, decision trees, k-­nearest neighbor algorithm, neural networks

                - regression: the given data, fit the data with a model to get the best-­fit parameters
                    - linear regression, logistic regression, and polynomial regression.
    2. Unsupervised Learning
        - fed with unlabeled data
        - algorithms will study the data and divide it into groups according to features
        - used for clustering and association
            - clustering: used for clustering and association
                - used for clustering and association
            - association: means to discover rules that describe the majority portion of the data.
                - Apriori algorithm
    3. Semi-Supervised Learning
    4. Reinforcement learning
